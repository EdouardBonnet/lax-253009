# Closure of NP and coNP under polynomial-time reductions

## Main results

- `mem_NP_preimage` — polynomial-time preprocessing preserves membership
  in `NP`.
- `MapReducesPoly.mem_NP` / `MapReducesPoly.mem_coNP` — membership in `NP`
  and `coNP` transports backward along Karp reductions.
- `NPComplete.mem_coNP_iff_NP_eq_coNP` — an NP-complete language lies in
  `coNP` iff `NP = coNP` (Arora–Barak, discussion after Definition 2.20).

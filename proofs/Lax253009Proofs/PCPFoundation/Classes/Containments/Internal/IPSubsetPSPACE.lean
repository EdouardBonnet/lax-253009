# `IP ⊆ PSPACE` — the strategy space is finite

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

A prover strategy is a function on *all* transcripts, of which there are infinitely many, so the
supremum over strategies that `IP` quantifies is a supremum over an infinite set. A machine
cannot search that. The first thing to establish is therefore that the quantifier is really
finite: a run of `prot.rounds n` rounds only ever consults the strategy on transcripts of length
below `2 · rounds n`, so two strategies agreeing there are indistinguishable.

That is what these lemmas say. Together with the message-length bound carried by
`ProverStrategy.Bounded`, they cut the search down to a finite game tree of polynomial depth,
which is the object a depth-first polynomial-space evaluation walks.

## Main results

- `Protocol.transcript_length` — a run of `n` rounds produces `2 n` messages
- `Protocol.transcript_congr` — **strategy extensionality** for the transcript
- `Protocol.accepts_congr`, `Protocol.acceptEvent_congr` — and for acceptance

title: Finite graphs and their binary encoding
type: definition
---
A graph on $n$ vertices is a symmetric Boolean adjacency matrix with zero
diagonal. Its vertices are $0,\ldots,n-1$. We encode it by $n$ one-bits,
one zero-bit, and its complete adjacency matrix in row-major order.
The encoding has length $n+1+n^2$, so polynomial time in its length is
equivalent to polynomial time in the number of vertices.

The clique number $\omega(G)$ is the maximum cardinality of a clique.
